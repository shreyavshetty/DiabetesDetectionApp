# DiabetesDetectionApp
### Discription
This is Web Application for detection of the diabetes based on the parameters that the user enters. It predicts whether it is benign or malignant by learning from the parameters. We have developed a deep neural network model to classify if the user has diabetes or not. The model is trained based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset from  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Includes cost data (donated by Peter Turney). 
### Technology Used
For the front end HTML5,CSS and bootstrap has been used. Flask based python is the backend. All interactions with the backend are made via RESTful API calls. A python ML model has been used to predict the disease stage. The weights of the trained model are saved and when a call is made to predict the model, inference is done based on the model weights. Iframes have been used to implement Ajax Patterns.
